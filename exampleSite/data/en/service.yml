    content: "We know what it takes to transform your existing infra setup towards
      infra-as-code for on-premise and AWS, Azure environments. We know what your
      DevOps teams need in terms of Infra-as-Code to develop their killer apps. \n\nOur
      engineers have made their hands very dirty and know how complex on-prem legacy
      apps can be. Transformation of your apps to Cloud easy? If you believe the Powerpoint
      based \"lift and shift\" fairy tails that is fine.\n\nIf you want the honest
      story, you are at the right address and we are more than happy to explain the
      details with a coffee and whiteboard. \n\nEach of us covers a wide variety of
      infra and cloud technologies. We spend a lot of time on continuous learning.
      This is not a luxury but a necessity to stay relevant and to keep our multi-skilled
      profiles in shape. \n\nWe are proud on what we deliver and want to be measured
      and recognised for the quality output rather than our inputs. Therefore we will
      agree with you on realistic tangible outcomes for projects and individual assigments. "

    content: "What does Infra-as-Code (IaC) really mean? How can you adopt IaC within
      your organisation?  After our initial conversations with various end users,
      admins, infra owners, we will do our homework and come back with two half day
      workshops to explain, outline and agree on the next steps to implement IaC within
      your organisation.  \n\nWe are not Powerpoint junkies nor report writers, together
      with you we agree on a plan that fits your organisation setup & maturity level.
      Our plan contains detailed short term backlog items and a clear realistic outlook
      towards the near future."
  - content: "Our hands-on knowledge on IT infrastructure combined with years of strategic
      IT consultancy and delivery offers a unique combination.\n\nYou know your business
      and strategy better than anyone, no doubt about that. We will help you avoid
      the pitfalls and explain the dilemmas that come with such a transformation.
      \n\nExamples as: \"Should you go for an early closure of your DC or IT service
      provider contract and go for a lift and shift to cloud OR transform and modernise
      your application portfolio and gradually move toward cloud\"\n\nBoth have their
      pros and cons and will depend on many aspects on what is right for you. We can
      help you make that desicion from our independent outside in view. "
