    content: "We know what it takes to transform your exiting infra setup towards
      AWS and AZURE landingzones. We know what your DevOps teams need in terms of
      Infra as Code to create their killer apps. \n\nOur engineers have made their
      hands very dirty and know how complex on-prem legacy apps can be. Transformation
      of your apps to Cloud easy?  If you believe in powerpoint based \"lift and shift
      fairy tails\" that is fine. \n\nIf you want a honest story, you are at the right
      address and we are more than happy to explain it over a coffee and whiteboard
      session. \n\nEach of us covers a wide variety of infra and cloud technologies.
      We spend at least 10% of our time on Continious Learning. This is needed to
      stay relevant and certified to keep our  multi-skilled profiles in shape. \n\nWe
      are proud of what we deliver and want to be measured and recognised for our
      quality output rather than inputs. ( hour rate)  Therefor we will agree with
      you on realistic tangible outcomes for projects and period based deliverables
      for semi-periodic jobs. "

    content: "What does Infra as Code really mean? How can you adopt IaC within your
      organisation?  After our initial conversations with various end users, admins,
      infra owners, we will do our homework and come back with two half day workshops
      to explain, outline and agree on the next steps to implement IaC within your
      organisation.  \n\nWe are no powerpoint junkies nor report writers, together
      with you we agree on a plan that fits your organisation setup & maturity level.
      Our plan contains detailed short term backlog items and an clear outlook towards
      the near future.   "
  - content: "Our years of IT infra/cloud and IT enterprise hands on knowlegde combined
      with years of strategic It consultancy and delivery with the big firms offers
      a unique combination.  \n\nYou know your business and strategy to follow the
      best, no doubt about that. We will help you avoid the pitfalls and explain the
      dillema's that come with such a transformation. \n\nExamples as: \"Should you
      go for an early closure of your DC or IT service provider contract and go for
      an lift and shift to cloud OR Transform/modernise your application portfolio
      and gradually move toward cloud\"\n\nBoth have their pro's and con's and will
      depend on many aspects  on what  is right for you.  We can help you make that
      desicion from our independent outside in view. "
